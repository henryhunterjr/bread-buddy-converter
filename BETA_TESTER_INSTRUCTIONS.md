**Subject:** Help Me Test Bread Buddy Converter (Beta)

---

Hey [Name],

You mentioned wanting to convert recipes between sourdough and yeast. I built a tool for that and I'd love your feedback before launch.

**🔗 TRY IT HERE:** https://d0f5bbed-853d-4f28-90ba-7781f1963723.lovableproject.com

### WHAT TO TEST:
- Convert **2-3 of YOUR recipes** (ones you actually bake)
- Try **both directions**: sourdough→yeast AND yeast→sourdough
- Try different input methods: **paste text, upload a photo, upload PDF**

### WHAT I NEED FEEDBACK ON:
1. **Does the hydration make sense?** (should stay roughly the same)
2. **Are ingredient amounts reasonable?** (especially for enriched doughs)
3. **Is the PDF useful?** Would you actually use it?
4. **Did anything confuse you or break?**
5. **What's missing?** What would make you use this regularly?

### HOW TO SHARE FEEDBACK:
Reply to this message or post in the group with **"BETA TEST:"**

Include:
- What recipe you tested
- What worked
- What didn't work or confused you
- Your browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.)

**Or click "Report Issue" button** in the app (sends email to henrysbreadkitchen@gmail.com)

### THIS IS BETA
If something breaks, that's **exactly** what I need to know! Don't worry about "bothering me" - every bug report makes it better.

Thanks for helping make this better.

\- Henry

**P.S.** - You're seeing this before anyone else. Feel free to share with other bakers who'd find it useful.

Hey [Name],

Just checking in - did you get a chance to test Bread Buddy Converter?

**Link again:** [link]

No pressure if you're busy! But if you have 10 minutes, even testing ONE recipe helps a lot.

Most useful feedback so far:
- "Levain amounts were perfect" ✅
- "PDF download didn't work on Safari" ❌ (now fixed)
- "Would love to adjust hydration" 💡

Let me know if you hit any issues or have questions!

## Beta Tester Recruiting Tips

**Where to find beta testers:**

   - Sourdough baking groups
   - Bread baking communities
   - "The Fresh Loaf" forums
   
2. **Reddit**
   - r/Sourdough
   - r/Breadit
   - r/Baking

**How many testers do you need?**
- **Minimum:** 5 testers (catch most critical issues)

- ❌ Just wants to be "first" (won't actually test)

**Managing feedback:**
- Create a simple spreadsheet:
  - Tester name
  - Date tested
  - Recipes tested
  - Issues found
  - Follow-up needed?
- Respond to EVERY tester within 24 hours
- Fix critical bugs immediately
- Note "nice-to-have" features for post-launch

## Quick Response Templates

**When tester reports a bug:**
```
Thanks for catching that! Can you tell me:
1. What browser were you using?
2. What recipe were you converting?
3. Can you send a screenshot?

This is super helpful - fixing it now!
```

**When tester suggests a feature:**
```
Great idea! That makes a lot of sense for [use case].

I'm adding it to the roadmap for post-launch. 
Want me to let you know when it's ready?
```

Awesome! That's exactly what I want to hear.

One more question: Would you actually USE this for your baking?

```

**When tester hasn't responded:**
```
Hey! Just wanted to make sure you got the testing link.

No pressure if you're busy - but even 5 minutes testing ONE recipe helps!

Let me know if you have any questions.
